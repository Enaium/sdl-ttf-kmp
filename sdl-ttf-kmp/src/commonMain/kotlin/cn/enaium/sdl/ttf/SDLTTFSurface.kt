/**
 * Internal: wraps a raw SDL_Surface handle created by SDL_ttf's render
 * functions in an [SDLSurface], or returns null for a null pointer.
 *
 * [owned] controls whether [SDLSurface.close] destroys the underlying
 * surface. Note that the returned surface is NOT the sdl-kmp platform
 * implementation, so APIs that downcast it (such as
 * [cn.enaium.sdl.SDLRenderer.createTextureFromSurface]) will reject it;
 * upload the surface to a texture with
 * `renderer.createTexture(format, access, width, height)` +
 * [cn.enaium.sdl.SDLTexture.update] instead, or blit it with the
 * [cn.enaium.sdl.SDLSurface] API directly.
